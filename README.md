<br />
<br />
<h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
<li>RandomForest is model comprises with multiple decision trees and works by combining the predictions of multiple individual decision trees to make accurate predictions. </li>

<li>Each tree has a diverse set of features to consider during the splitting process.</li>

<li>It independently evaluates the input symptoms and assigns a predicted disease label. The final prediction is determined through majority voting, where the most commonly predicted disease label across the trees is selected.</li>

<h2> Limitations</h2> <br />
Please note that the ByteCare: Symptom Diagnosis System is not a substitute for professional medical advice. It cannot provide a comprehensive diagnosis considering the user's medical history, family history, and other factors that only a trained medical professional can evaluate. Instead, the system serves as a tool to assist in the diagnosis process and help individuals make informed decisions about their medical care.
